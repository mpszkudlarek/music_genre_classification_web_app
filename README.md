# Music Genre Classification Web Application

## Overview
This project, developed as my engineering thesis at Politechnika Wroc≈Çawska, introduces a web application for music genre recognition using convolutional neural networks (CNNs).

## Key Features
- **Genre Recognition using CNN**: Implements a convolutional neural network model trained on the GTZAN dataset.
- **MFCC Feature Extraction**: Utilizes the LibROSA library for extracting Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) and stores them in a JSON format.
- **Segmentation Mechanism**: Features a unique segmentation approach for music files, including partial overlap of segments, to analyze entire tracks comprehensively.
- **Average-based Prediction**: Calculates prediction results as the average of the sum of all segments and presents the three most probable genres.

## Research and Development
Extensive research was conducted focusing on the accuracy of predictions, scalability, and hardware resource consumption. The project also outlines future directions for further enhancements and development.
